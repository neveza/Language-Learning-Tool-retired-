# Language-Learning-Tool-retired-
I originally created this as a flash card that pulls from an .ODS file. Probably the most complex project I've ever done. This is not as documented as I wished. I abandoned it as I got overwhelmed by the project due to lack of knowledge/skill
originally, it did work, but due to Windows failure, I lost the prototype and what I do have doesn't seem to work anymore.
I always considered going back, but I think the code is all over the place, especially when implementing the Async as that blind-sided me
due to lack of experience.
